    <h2>Durango</h2>
    <p>Durango is a small town of 19,000 nestled at an elevation of 6,522â€™ in the foothills of the San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado. Once a frontier mining town, Durango has become popular for the myriad outdoor recreational activities and scenic beauty. Mountain bikers, rafters, kayakers, horseback riders, rock climbers, hikers, campers, hunters and fisherman are drawn to the two-million acre San Juan National Forest and to the San Juan Mountains, the largest range in the Rockies. Mesa Verde is just a short drive from Durango, and home to cliff dwellings created by the ancestral Puebloans over 700 years ago. The Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, which hauled precious metals in the 1880s, now take tourists for a 47-mile open air journey through mountains and forests and past abandoned mines to historic Silverton and back on historic steam locomotives. 
        Skiers flock in winter to Purgatory Mountains resort, which offers hiking, fishing, rafting and horseback riding in warmer months. Historic Downtown Durango boasts Victorian buildings, numerous restaurants, galleries, stores, pubs and coffeeshops.</p>
